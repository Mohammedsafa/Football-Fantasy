# Football Fantasy Project
This is a C++ project developed as part of a group team effort for the Data Structure course. The project focuses on implementing a football fantasy league system with two leagues, La Liga and Premier League. Users are provided with a budget of 100k to build their own teams and compete against each other.

# Features
 - Team Building: Users can use their allocated budget to select players and build their own teams. The budget constraint adds a strategic element to the game, requiring users to make wise choices to optimize their team's performance.
 - League Selection: Users have the option to choose between two leagues, La Liga and Premier League. This adds variety and allows users to compete in their preferred league.
 - Lucky Wheel: A lucky wheel feature is available for users, providing an element of chance to the game. Users can spin the wheel to obtain bonuses, additional budget, or other rewards that can give them an advantage over other players.
 - Team Updates: Users can update their teams throughout the competition, similar to fantasy football. This allows them to make changes based on player performance, injuries, or other factors that may affect their team's success.
 - Administrator Privileges: An admin user has special permissions to manage the system. They can determine the points system, add or remove players and teams, update player information, and reset points. Admins play a crucial role in maintaining fairness and ensuring the smooth operation of the game
 - Competition Rounds: The competition consists of five rounds, during which users compete against each other based on the performance of their teams. At the end of the five rounds, the winner of the competition is determined based on the accumulated points.
   
# Data Structures Used
This project utilizes the following data structures:
- Hash Tables: Hash tables are used to efficiently store and retrieve player and team information. They provide fast access to data based on unique keys, allowing for quick retrieval and modification of player and team details.
- Vectors: Vectors are used to store and manipulate dynamic arrays of player and team objects. They provide flexibility in managing the size of the data structures and offer efficient random access to elements.

# Usage
Upon running the program, users will be prompted with a menu of options to interact with the system. They can navigate through the menu using numeric input and follow the instructions provided.

Admin users should provide their credentials to access the administrative features. Regular users can proceed with team building, updates, and competing in the league.
